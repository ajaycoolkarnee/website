<h3>Dance</h3>
<p id="p1">dance, the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, 
    usually to music and within a given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion, 
    releasing energy, or simply taking delight in the movement itself.</p>
<br>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>Music can raise someone's mood, get them excited, or make them calm and relaxed. Music also - and this is important - 
    allows us to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience in our lives.</p>
